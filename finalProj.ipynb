    "As an introductory to the Game of UNO I would encourage you to read [manual](https://www.maxiaids.com/Media/Uploaded/26787.pdf) a UNO card game manual. If you are already familiar with UNO, as I thought I was, then you would assume that barring any obvious mistakes that the game is entirely decided upon luck within the shuffling of the deck. For these simulations I will be simulating 1v1 games between two bots. As you may not know a Game of Uno does not end once a player has gotten rid of all their cards, instead there is a scoring system(see manual) to count your opponents cards left over and that is added to your score. Generally an UNO Game is played until one player reaches 500 points. This project started when I went camping and met this couple that had been playing for years and they began to tell me a little bit about the different strategies they employ in 1v1 play. At first I thought it was quite ridiculous and decided to run some simulations on which strategies would compete the best. A particular startegy they told me about that they believed would be best was \"High-Card out\" that is always play your highest value card. Another bot I coded(linkModes) plays by playing the card which matches either its color or number to the most cards in the players hand to give the player the best chance to play again the next turn instead of drawing cards. \n",

    "**NOTES**: \n",
    "\n",
    "- All code regarding the gameplay of UNO has been writen in C++. Instead of linking a C program to Python I have instead opted to manually export and render data in Python for my analyses.\n",
    "- I will include all function commands given to the C program so that the data is easily replicated \n",
    "- A list of all functions will be included below however the C file uno.cc will be separate but executable.\n"

    "**CODE OVERVIEW**: \n",
    "\n",
    "The code attached as uno.cc consists of a few different functions to test gameplay. Each Round of UNO is unique in that once a round is over the deck is reshuffled and there is no bias data carried over to the next round this allows me to run many rounds all at once and aggregate the data to make assumptions about smaller sample sizes. So although a game of UNO is generally played to 500 points it is still valid to play a game to 100,000 points and then use that data to make accurate estimates as to how a game to 500 points would result. In most turns of UNO the player does not have enough cards to actually be able to choose between cards in this case the 'play' function will deal with playing the only availale card. The function playablecards finds the cards in the hand which can be played. If there are multiple cards available to play then one of the 3 bots are chosen, either linkModes, Random, or HighestValue. To change which bot is playing the 'play' function contains a function input variable. This variable can be changed in 'main' as noted by the comments in uno.cc . If you would like to see the gameplay of a single round use test.cc .\n",
    "<br>**TO COMPILE USE:**\n",
    "- g++ -Wall -o uno.o uno.cc\n",
    "or if testing a single round\n",
    "- g++ -Wall -o test.o test.cc\n",
    "<br> **TO RUN**\n",
    "- ./uno.o\n",
    "- ./test.o\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**METHODS OVERVIEW**: First to define terminology of the gameplay to allow for a more precise analysis of the gameplay:\n",
    "- A round will be defined as the period between the shuffling of a new deck, dealing cards to players and the gameplay up until the point at which one player has zero cards left in their hand\n",
    "- A Game consists of multiple rounds up to the point at which one player has acheived a certain number of points, generally 500 in a standard game but I will be using 10,000 points to decide the winner of a single game.\n",
    "- A turn: The action of seeing the card previously placed and choosing a card from the players hand to place down, a turn is over once the player has placed down a card or cannot play.\n",
    "- PPR: stands for points per round it is calculated using only the rounds won so it is equivalent to (game score/rounds won)\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate gameplay I will be looking at how these bots compete against eachother over thousands of rounds and using signifiers like points earned per round, # rounds won, overall game score, round win rate, and the percentage of turns in which the bot is given a choice between multiple cards. All simulations of multiple round gameplay was done giving players alternating starts unless otherwise specified.\n",
    "**STRATEGIES**\n",
    "- **linkModes:** This staregy builds off the assumption that whatever card is played the opponents card is most likley to match either the number or color of your card. so this selection method sums up all the cards in your hand which share either the same color or number as the card you are about to play and bases its decision off of the card with the most links hence the name link modes. essentially it selects the card which it can play the most cards off of to avoid having to draw cards. \n",
    "- **HighestValue:** selects a card from the playable cards in your hand that has the highest value, not considering black cards unless no other option is available.\n",
    "- **Random:** Randomly chooses a card from playable cards using rand() seeded at time(0) \n"

Here we find that each bot set itself up to have a playable card 66.4% of the time, this is very good although I would expect the linkModes bot to do a lot better.**\n",

    "Given more time I would like to explore the variance of the PPR and would like to further look into why linkModes does not perform as well as I thought it would. As for the intent and results of this simulation I have found what I currently believe to be the best strategy to play UNO,HighestValue, and I don't believe any more analyses of the data is needed to come to this conclusion. Programming of a bug free uno game proved much more time consuming and difficult than I thought it would be but I have created a bug free simulation that can be run limitless times without fail which will allow me to do easy further analyses once I am able to bind the C program to python without having to do any error catching in python.
